## 🧠 Identity

I operate at the intersection of **Applied Physics, Systems Engineering, and Cybersecurity**.

I don’t chase tools.  
I analyze **systems**.

How they behave.  
How they fail.  
How they can be hardened.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus (2026)

- Windows system diagnostics & internal monitoring  
- Blue Team detection logic & anomaly awareness  
- Linux internals & system-level security  
- Offline-first security tooling  
- Automation for IT support workflows  
- Embedded systems + IoT security awareness  

Security is not panic.  
Security is disciplined engineering.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Orientation

- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark, PCAP inspection)
- Enumeration & scanning logic (Nmap methodology)
- Windows internals monitoring (registry, services, scheduled tasks)
- Blue Team fundamentals (baseline vs anomaly detection)
- Red Team reconnaissance theory
- Linux system security principles
- OWASP Top 10 awareness

I study both attacker logic and defensive architecture.

## 📡 What I Build

- 🛡 Offline Windows diagnostic tools  
- 👁 Local system monitoring assistants  
- 📦 Secure LAN-based file transfer utilities  
- 🤖 Automation-focused Telegram bots  
- 🔌 Arduino & IoT security prototypes  
- 📊 Data & trend analysis experiments  

Everything is practical.  
Everything solves a real constraint.

## 🎓 Academic Foundation

**B.Sc. Applied Physics & Electronics (Undergraduate)**  
Eastern University, Sri Lanka  

Physics trained precision.  
Electronics trained logic.  
Cybersecurity applies both under pressure.

## 🌍 Based in Sri Lanka. Building for Anywhere.

Technology has no geography.  
Discipline does.

Sri Lanka is where I operate from.  
Systems engineering is where I operate in.
